# website-recipes

This is my first project while following The Odin Project.

The website is made only using html. 
It features 1 index and 3 recipe html files: index.html, applePie.html, chickenBurger.html, pumpkinBread.html.
On the index page you can travel to each of the recipe pages and back. 
There are pictures included in each recipe, the recipe's author name, 
unordered ingredient and ordered instruction lists.
